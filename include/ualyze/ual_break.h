    Perform cluster and line breaking analysis.  After analysis, the char
    buffer will have break flags set at the start of each cluster, and at
    each break opportunity (at the character that would start the new line).

    For each break opportunity, a trailing space flag is set at the space
    character that starts a contiguous run of space characters before the
    break, or at the break opportunity itself if the run is empty.
